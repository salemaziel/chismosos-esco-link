# Updated FlatHub V2 Theme from Alexandra Travkina
Edited and updated by **WebCrew** / Andreas Holzer - [crazymates.de](https://crazymates.de)

I have already fixed the most important bugs, there was a lot to do. Please feel free to give me a **STAR** here on my repository. **STARS** provide incentives to continue doing something for the HumHub community. 

A few small problems still have to be patched - but here I ask an **experienced Yii programmer** to help me and the community please, my knowledge is not enough - thank you very much for that.

The theme can be used with small restrictions, but the last few bugs still have to be fixed by someone, so please **clone the repository and help**.
